= Spring Data for Apache Solr image:https://jenkins.spring.io/buildStatus/icon?job=spring-data-solr%2Fmaster&subject=Build[link=https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-solr/]

====
**Migrated version to Spring framework 6
**
====

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data for Apache Solr project provides integration with the https://lucene.apache.org/solr/[Apache Solr] search engine

Providing its own extensible `MappingSolrConverter` as alternative to `DocumentObjectBinder` Spring Data for Apache Solr handles inheritance as well as usage of custom Types such as `Point` or `DateTime`

== Features

* High level repository abstractions with multicore support
* Annotations for Boost-, Facet- and Highlighting
* Customizable type mappings and type conversions
* Solr template supporting fluent query api
* Exception translation to Spring’s portable Data Access exception hierarchy

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

    repository.deleteAll();

    Person person = new Person();
    person.setFirstname("Christoph");
    person.setLastname("Strobl");
    repository.save(person);

    List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Strobl");
    List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("C*");
 }
}

@Configuration
@EnableSolrRepositories(schemaCreationSupport = true)
class Config {

  @Bean
  public SolrClient solrClient() {
    return new HttpSolrClient("http://localhost:8983/solr");
  }
}
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.shinusuresh</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-solr</artifactId>
  <version>5.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle configuration
[source,groovy]
---
implementation("io.github.shinusuresh:spring-data-solr:5.1.0")
